# discord-anyplayer-bot
Discord bot that plays any file it has access to on its drive.  Can play streaming radio too.

## Why

I made this because I wanted a way of easily playing music that was stored on a server.

## What You Can Do

The only thing you can do with this thing is play files and streams.

The only command is "play".

You invoke it with `>play $FILENAME` or `>play $STREAM`, where $FILENAME needs to be a full path to a file you know is stored on the same drive as the place where your bot is running, and $STREAM is a full URL such as https://nthmost.net:8000/mutiny-studio

All of the initial setup and dependenices are basically the same.
